Welcome to the Supply Chain Sandbox site. We are located in Moscone South, 2nd floor, pod 2b. The Sandbox area will be open
* Tuesday, February 25, 2020 - 4:30pm - 6:00pm Pacific Time
* Wednesday, February 26, 2020 - 8:00am - 4:00pm Pacific Time
* Thursday, February 27, 2020 - 8:00am - 3:30pm Pacific Time

The Sandbox main stage will feature talks from experts in the field, relevant to the Sandboxes. [Session times, topics, and speakers](https://www.rsaconference.com/usa/agenda/full-agenda?deliveryformat=Sandbox&location=USA&year=2020)

# About the Supply Chain Sandbox
Supply chain management is a critical factor of business success. As software increasingly drives business value, organizations can achieve greater efficiency, agility, and effectiveness - as well as security - by applying similar principles to their cyber supply chains. Vulnerabilities in components such as processors, network stacks, and platform dependencies have shown that supply chain visibility is shallow, while risk runs deep.

In a just-in-time-delivery world, cybersecurity disruptions to traditional logistics and planning. Not Petya halted operations for shipping companies worldwide, providing a vivid illustration of how dependent organizations have become on their partners’ cybersecurity for physical, as well as digital, assets.

The Supply Chain Sandbox is an interactive environment, with hands on games and demonstrations that illustrate supply chain issues, as well as concepts and approaches to manage them more effectively. Learn concepts like the Software Bill of Materials, a framework for pinpointing cyber supply chain risk, and other principles - all while having more fun than you thought you could at a cybersecurity conference!

# Presentations at the Supply Chain Sandbox
We will hold a number of brief presentations in the Supply Chain Sandbox space. Session times, topics, and speakers will be posted later.

# Supply Chain Principles
[Software in the Supply Chain Era](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/supply-chain-in-the-software-era/)
* **Supplier-Facilitated Risk:** Cybersecurity of third-party partners who can influence energy-sector operations. For instance, systems integrators who design and implement products into energy-sector operations environments, as well as other vendors who have physical or network access.
* **Counterfeit:** Components that come through an unauthorized channel, are not authentic, and would fail a sufficiently rigorous validation. Counterfeiters are typically motivated by financial gain, buying inex- pensive components and passing them off as more expensive ones. Negative impacts on energy operations are often an unintended consequence.
* **Malicious Taint:** Components that often come through authorized channels, are authentic, and pass highly rigorous validation. Nonetheless, these components have some unintended functionality when placed intentionally by an adversary, which has negative implications on reliability, security, and safety. Typically, introducing malicious taint requires very high-level capabilities and resources, such as those a nation-state may possess.
* **Unintended Taint:** Components that come through authorized channels, are authentic, and pass highly rigorous validation. Nonetheless, these components contain quality defects in the form of software flaws or vulnerabilities, which may be known or unknown to the producer at the time of implementation.

* **Counterfeit parts:** This threat category describes the insertion of counterfeit parts in the supply chain that can have severe consequences in systems and services provided to upstream customers. These threats are associated with the replacement or substitution of trusted or qualified supplier components, products, or services with those from potentially untrusted sources.
* **Cybersecurity:** This threat category represents threats that result from the set of vulnerabilities associated with external attacks on suppliers’ operations and capabilities. These threats are the result of an external actor executing a sophisticated attack, such as zero-day or malware, with an objective of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the supplier information, products, or services.
* **Internal Security Operations and Controls:** This threat category is closely related to the Cybersecurity threat category identified above. The primary differentiator is that these threats are a result of challenges in internal supplier processes that enable the exploitation of weaknesses in basic cyber hygiene (e.g., software patching), user awareness (e.g., spear phishing), mishandling of sensitive information, or internal cybersecurity process failures from the lack of a cybersecurity program based on best practices such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework.
* **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Processes and Tools:** This threat category represents those threats that impact the suppliers’ ability to develop products or services that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of products and services developed by the supplier. Examples of these threats are the embedding of malware or other vulnerabilities in the products and services delivered by a supplier, introduction of malware into software products through use of vulnerable open source libraries and embedding of foreign developed computer code.
* **Insider threats:** This threat category focuses on the vulnerability of the supplier to attacks from trusted staff and partners internally embedded in the supplier operations. Most of the threats identified in this grouping are associated with intentional tampering or interference.
* **Economic risks:** Economic risks stem from threats to the financial viability of suppliers, and the potential impact to the supply chain resulting from the failure of a key supplier. Other threats to the supply chain that result in economic risks include but are not limited to: vulnerabilities to cost volatility, reliance on single source suppliers, cost to swap out suspect vendors, and resource constraints due to company size.
* **Inherited Risk (Extended supplier chain):** This threat category is a result of current supply chains that extend broadly across industries and geographies. These threats typically are associated with the challenge of extending controls and best practices through the entire supply chain due to its global and multi-tiered nature. It also includes the vulnerabilities that can result from integration of components, products, or services from a lower-tier supplier where a prior determination of acceptable risk may not flow all the way through the development process to the end user supplier.
* **Legal risks:** This threat category comes from supplier vulnerabilities specific to legal jurisdiction. Some examples include weak anti-corruption laws, lack of regulatory oversight, and weak intellectual property considerations. This also includes the threats that result from country specific laws, policies, and practices intended to undermine competition and free market protections, such as the requirement to transfer technology and intellectual property to domestic providers in a foreign country.
* **External end-to-end supply chain risks (natural disasters, geo-political issues):** This threat category is associated with broad based environmental, geopolitical, regulatory compliance, workforce, and other vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of supplier information, products, or services.
